- **Update regularly** - Keep current
- **Add notes** - Context is valuable
- **Tag appropriately** - Use relevant tags

```

Vendors (Service providers)
```

```
VIP Clients:     < 1 hour 🔥
Active Buyers:   < 4 hours
Warm Leads:      < 24 hours

Vendors:         < 24 hours
```

Follow-up:        WhatsApp
Formal Docs:      Email
Updates:          WhatsApp/Email
Emergencies:      Phone call
```
