## Overview

### What is the Leads Module?

The Leads Module is your **sales pipeline** for tracking potential buyers and sellers from first contact to deal creation. It uses a proven **21-day follow-up system** with a structured **5-stage pipeline** to maximize conversion rates.

✅ **Track Sources** - Know where your best leads come from  
✅ **Measure Performance** - Conversion rates, response times, ROI

## Understanding the 21-Day Lead System

### Why 21 Days?

Research shows that **systematic follow-up over 21 days** dramatically increases conversion:

```
Day 1:    First Contact        (Contact rate: 100%)
Day 2:    Follow-up #1         (Contact rate: 60%)
Day 4:    Follow-up #2         (Contact rate: 40%)
Day 7:    Follow-up #3         (Contact rate: 30%)
Day 14:   Follow-up #4         (Contact rate: 20%)
Day 21:   Final Follow-up      (Contact rate: 15%)

Result: 3-5x higher conversion vs. single contact
```

### The 21-Day Schedule

**aaraazi automatically reminds you when to follow up**:

### Lead Decay & Urgency

**Leads lose value over time if not contacted**:

```
Day 1-3:   HOT 🔥 (Contact immediately!)
Day 4-7:   WARM 🌡️ (High priority)
Day 8-14:  COOLING 🧊 (Don't delay)
Day 15-21: COLD ❄️ (Last chance)
Day 22+:   LOST 💀 (Very low conversion)
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### Lead Response Time

**Industry Standard**:
```
Within 5 minutes:  78% contact rate 🔥
Within 1 hour:     60% contact rate
Within 24 hours:   30% contact rate
After 24 hours:    15% contact rate
```

**Your Goal**: < 4 hours for all leads

### First Contact Best Practices

✅ **DO**:
- Call within 4 hours
- Use their name
- Reference their specific inquiry
- Ask open-ended questions
- Listen more than talk
- Set clear next steps
- Schedule second contact

❌ **DON'T**:
- Wait until "tomorrow"
- Use generic scripts
- Talk too much
- Push for immediate decision
- Skip qualifying questions
- End without next step

### Qualifying Questions (BANT Framework)

**Budget**:
- "What's your budget range?"
- "Do you have financing arranged?"
- "Is this budget confirmed or flexible?"

**Authority**:
- "Who else is involved in the decision?"
- "Are you the primary decision maker?"
- "Does your spouse need to approve?"

**Need**:
- "Why are you looking to buy/sell now?"
- "What's driving this decision?"
- "What problem are you trying to solve?"

**Timeline**:
- "When do you want to move?"
- "Is there a deadline?"
- "What's your ideal timeline?"

### Pipeline Velocity

**Measure how fast leads move**:

```
Average Days Per Stage:
NEW → CONTACTED:     1-2 days (ideal)
CONTACTED → QUALIFIED: 7-14 days
QUALIFIED → NEGOTIATION: 14-30 days
NEGOTIATION → CLOSED: 7-14 days

Total Pipeline Time: 30-60 days (average)
```

**Red Flags**:
- Lead in NEW > 3 days (contact them!)
- Lead in CONTACTED > 21 days (qualify or disqualify)
- Lead in QUALIFIED > 60 days (re-assess)

### Lead Source Tracking

**Always track source to measure ROI**:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LEAD SOURCE PERFORMANCE (Q1 2026)  │
│                                    │

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Lead Not Responding

**Problem**: Called/emailed multiple times, no response.

**Solutions**:
1. **Try different channels**:
   - Called? Try WhatsApp
   - Emailed? Try SMS
   - Morning calls? Try evening

2. **Change your approach**:
   - Instead of "Following up..."
   - Try "New listing you might like..."
   - Add value, don't just chase

3. **Set it aside**:
   - After 21 days, move to nurture
   - Monthly touches only
   - Don't waste time

#### Issue: Lead Stuck in Stage

**Problem**: Lead in CONTACTED for 30+ days.

**Solutions**:
1. **Qualify or Disqualify**:
   - Ask direct questions
   - "Are you still interested?"
   - "What's holding you back?"

2. **Identify blocker**:
   - Budget issues?
   - Timeline changed?
   - Found another property?

3. **Make a decision**:
   - Move to QUALIFIED if ready
   - Move to CLOSED (Lost) if not
   - Don't let leads rot

#### Issue: Too Many Leads

**Problem**: Can't keep up with follow-ups.

**Solutions**:
1. **Prioritize by score**:
   - Focus on HOT (80+) first
   - Then WARM (50-79)
   - Automate COLD (<50)

2. **Use templates**:
   - Email templates
   - WhatsApp templates
   - Save time

3. **Get help**:
   - Delegate to team
   - Hire assistant
   - Use automation

## FAQs

### General Questions

**Q: What's the difference between a lead and a deal?**  
A: A **lead** is a potential customer (interested but not committed). A **deal** is an active transaction (offer made, negotiating). Leads become deals.

**Q: How many leads should I have?**  
A: **Industry average**: 20-30 active leads per agent. Focus on quality over quantity.

**Q: What's a good conversion rate?**  
A: **Industry average**: 2-5% of leads become deals. Top performers: 10-15%.

**Q: How long should I follow up with a lead?**  
A: **Active follow-up**: 21 days. **Nurture**: 6-12 months. If no response after 21 days, move to low-priority nurture.

### Lead Scoring

**Q: Why is my lead score low?**  
A: Check the breakdown:
- Missing budget info?
- Vague timeline?
- No engagement (viewings)?
- Not qualified?

Update missing info to increase score.

**Q: Can I manually change a lead's score?**  
A: No, but you can update the data that affects score (budget, timeline, etc.).

**Q: Do lead scores update automatically?**  
A: Yes! As you log activities and update info, scores recalculate.

### 21-Day System

**Q: What if I contact them before Day 4?**  
A: Great! Mark the follow-up as complete. The system is a minimum, not maximum.

**Q: What if they don't respond by Day 21?**  
A: Move to nurture list (monthly touches). Don't chase unresponsive leads daily.

**Q: Can I customize the 21-day schedule?**  
A: Yes, use "Custom Follow-up" to create your own timing.

### Converting Leads

**Q: When should I convert a lead to a deal?**  
A: When they:
- Make an offer on a property
- Ask you to list their property
- Sign an agreement
- Commit to moving forward

**Q: What happens to the lead after conversion?**  
A: Lead marked as "Won" and moved to CLOSED stage. All history preserved. Deal created.

**Q: Can I convert a lead back if deal falls through?**  
A: Yes! Re-activate the lead and continue follow-up.
